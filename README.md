- TextMeWhen Version 1.1 is released! Please view that repository for my most recent work with full stack development.
- The TwitterQueryAndSentiment repository is the backend for a WIP project, which will soon be hosted on AWS and connected to a front end.
- All other pinned repositories are projects from classes that I have found most interesting.
